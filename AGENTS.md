## Code Style

### Minimal Editing

When fixing a bug or implementing a feature, change only what is necessary.
Do not rename variables, restructure working code, or refactor beyond the task at hand.
Keep diffs small and focused so they are easy to review.

## Git Workflow

<!-- TODO: Document your branching and merge strategy -->

## Boundaries

### ✅ Always

- Run tests after changes
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Preserve existing code structure — do not reorganize or refactor beyond the task
- Validate all external input

### ⚠️ Ask First

- Changing authentication mechanisms
- Adding new dependencies
- Modifying database schema

### 🚫 Never

- Commit secrets or credentials
- Skip input validation on external boundaries
